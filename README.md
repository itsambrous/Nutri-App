**Nutrition App - Calorie Counter**
This is a simple nutrition app that allows users to track their daily calorie intake, view macronutrient information, and manually research and input food prices. The app does not rely on external APIs for food data but provides a platform for users to manage their nutrition goals effectively.

**Features**
The Nutrition App - Calorie Counter includes the following features:

1. User Registration and Login: Users can create an account and log in to access their personal nutrition data.

2. Calorie Tracking: Users can input and track their daily calorie intake by adding food items to their meal log. The app will calculate and display the total calorie count for each meal and the entire day.

3. Food Database: The app includes a local database of food items. Users can search and select food items from the database to add to their meal log. Each food item has information on calories and macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, and fat).

4. Manual Food Price Research: Since no external APIs are available for food prices, users can manually research and input the price of each food item they consume. The app allows users to associate a price with each added food item.

5. .Meal Log: Users can view and edit their meal log, which displays the food items they have consumed for each meal. The meal log provides an overview of calories, macronutrients, and associated prices.

6. Macronutrient Information: The app calculates and displays the total intake of macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, and fat) based on the food items added to the meal log.

7. Goal Setting: Users can set daily calorie and macronutrient goals. The app provides feedback on progress towards the set goals, allowing users to monitor and adjust their nutrition accordingly.

8. Reports: The app generates reports summarizing daily calorie intake, macronutrient distribution, and associated costs. These reports help users gain insights into their nutritional habits.
